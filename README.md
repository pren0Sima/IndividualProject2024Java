## Description
This is a Java-based project implementing processes a basic transport company would have - hiring employees, transporting goods and passengers, and some accounting. The package manager used is Gradle. It also uses the JDBC API, allowing generation and control through the code. The DBMS (database managing system) used during development is MySQL Workbench. The database scheme looks like this:

## Installation and use
1. In a desired terminal write the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pren0Sima/IndividualProject2024Java.git
```
2. Open the project with a desired IDE (I have used IntelliJ IDEA Community edition).
3. Change the credentials for the database in the <b>hibernate.properties</b> file.
4. Run the programme and love your life!

In order to make changes to the contents of the database, the main file should simply be modified.
